- 🔭 I’m currently working on Encryption: **File Encryption and Decryption with Python This project implements a simple local file encryption and decryption mechanism using Python and the **Fernet** symmetric encryption algorithm from the `cryptography` library. Its purpose is to demonstrate how file contents can be protected through symmetric keys, allowing only holders of the correct key to restore the original data. The system is composed of two scripts: one responsible for generating a key and encrypting files in the working directory, and another responsible for decrypting them using the stored key. During execution, the scripts scan the folder, identify eligible files, and automatically apply the transformation process while skipping explicitly excluded files defined in the configuration. A key is generated once and stored in a dedicated key file, which is later reused for the decryption process. The workflow ensures that encrypted data can only be recovered with the same key, preserving content confidentiality. The project is intended for educational purposes, focusing on: * symmetric encryption concepts * binary file handling * key generation and storage * automated multi-file processing It is not intended for production or sensitive environments without additional safeguards, file scope controls, and backup procedures.**
